  abstract = {The neonatal Fc receptor, FcRn, plays a central role in immunoglobulin
	G (IgG) transport across placental barriers. Genetic variations of
	FcRn-dependent transport across the placenta may influence antibody-mediated
	pathologies of the fetus and the newborn. Sequencing analysis of
	20 unrelated individuals demonstrated no missense mutation within
	the five exons of the FcRn gene. However, a variable number of tandem
	repeats (VNTR) region within the FcRn promoter was observed, consisting
	of five different alleles (VNTR1-VNTR5). Alleles with two (VNTR2)
	and three (VNTR3) repeats were found to be most common in Caucasians
	(7.5 and 92.0\%, respectively). Real-time polymerase chain reaction
	revealed that monocytes from VNTR3 homozygous individuals express
	1.66-fold more FcRn transcript than do monocytes from VNTR2/VNTR3
	heterozygous individuals (P = 0.002). In reporter plasmid assays,
	the VNTR3 allele supported the transcription of a reporter gene twice
	as effectively as did the VNTR2 allele (P = 0.003). Finally, under
	acidic conditions, monocytes from VNTR3 homozygous individuals showed
	an increased binding to polyvalent human IgG when compared with monocytes
	from VNTR2/VNTR3 heterozygous individuals (P = 0.021). These data
	indicate that a VNTR promoter polymorphism influences the expression
	of the FcRn receptor, leading to different IgG-binding capacities.},
